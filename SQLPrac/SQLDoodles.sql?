# Below sorta satisfies the CRUD.

# Creates a table.
CREATE TABLE Android(
  name text,
  version float
);

# Inserts a new value to the specified columns.
INSERT INTO Android(name, version)
VALUES ("Kitkat", 4.4);

# Grabs all the contents from the specified column, from the specified table.
#     column     table
SELECT name FROM Android;

# Does the same thing as above, but from the multiple columns.
#       columns            table
SELECT name, version FROM Android;

# This pretty much tells the SQL to dump everything from the Database.
SELECT * FROM Android;

# In the SQL table, I can deliberately cause a duplication.
INSERT INTO Android(name, version)
VALUES ("Kitkat", 4.4);

# The below query will give everything back, including the duplicate we've just created.
SELECT * FROM Android;

# We can tell the SQL to give everything back without the duplication.
SELECT DISTINCT * Android;

# There is a way to order things around via using the grammar below
SELECT version FROM Android version ORDER BY version ASC
# Vice versa of the above statement.
SELECT version FROM Android version ORDER BY version DESC

# Under the assumption that Above queries were executed in a sequence,
DELETE FROM Android WHERE name="Kitkat";
# The query above will delete both of the duplicate "Kitkat" attributes
# everything within that row.

# The below updates the
UPDATE Android SET version=4.4 WHERE name="Lollipop";
UPDATE ANDROID SET name="Kitkat" WHERE version=4.4;
